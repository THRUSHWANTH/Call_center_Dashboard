# Call_center_Dashboard

The call center dashboard I created in Excel is a powerful tool that provides a visual representation of the key performance indicators (KPIs) of call center. It presents a summary of the data in an easy-to-understand format, allowing you to quickly analyze and make data-driven decisions.

The dashboard consists of multiple charts and tables, each representing a different aspect of your call center's performance. The first chart provides an overview of the number of calls received in each day of october month. The second pie chart shows from which channel the call centers get calls.

The third chart displays the reason for the calls from the users using bar graph.

The fourth map presents the numbers of calls received from the different states of America in the month of october.

Overall, the call center dashboard you created in Excel is an invaluable tool for monitoring and improving the performance of your call center. It provides a comprehensive overview of your call center's KPIs, allowing you to identify areas for improvement and take action to enhance customer satisfaction and optimize your operations.
